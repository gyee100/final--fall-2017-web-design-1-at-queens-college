	<p class = "aboutinfo">It’s hard to place when I began to draw, it was all <br>
quite a blur as a child. Surrounded by various<br>
action cartoons and superhero comics it’s no<br>
wonder I dreamed to be a hero. Those dreams<br>
became drawings and, whether the characters I<br>
adored or creations of my own, they always<br>
found their way on paper with the help of my<br>
crayons. Crayons became markers and markers<br>
became fine paints. For a long time, art has been<br>
a defining feature in my life and I believe there’s<br>
no better feeling than expressing myself<br>
through it. It may have started out as a hobby<br>
and it has always been fun to me, but I take<br>
great pride in addressing it at one of my<br>
passions.</p>
