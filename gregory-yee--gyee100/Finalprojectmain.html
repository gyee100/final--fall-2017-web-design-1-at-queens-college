<h3>About Me</h3>
<br/>
<p>Born in Manhattan and grew up in a small town in Long Island.<br>
I wondered what's it like to be someone and do something that I<br>
honestly loved. Still to this day, it surprises me to no end of what<br>
I can do. My main objective for my work is my expression of being<br>
free and happy. The photography and my graphic design uses my<br>
feelings to really thrive myself currently. The time of being in<br>
New York allows me to see how the world can truly be rather than<br>
my fake generalizations Most of my work comes from the day-to-day<br>
practice and my studies as a student.
